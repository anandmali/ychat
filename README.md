# YChatGPT (Working in Progress üöß)

ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that is trained to generate human-like text based on a given prompt or context.

YChatGPT aims to abstract all API call logic from ChatGPT for multiple platforms. YChatGPT is a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) project, that generates artifacts for both iOS and Android.
