# YChatGPT (Working in Progress üöß)

ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that is trained to generate human-like text based on a given prompt or context.

YChatGPT aims to abstract all API call logic from ChatGPT for multiple platforms. YChatGPT is a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) project, that generates artifacts for both iOS and Android.


## Android setup

Add the following line to import the library via Gradle. First, make sure Maven Central has been added:


```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    // ...
}
```

Then, simply import the dependency to your common source-set dependencies:

```kotlin
implementation("co.yml:ychatgpt:1.0.0")
```

In the snippet below, you can see how to initialize the object and perform a first search:


```kotlin
val yChatGpt by lazy {
  YChatGpt.create("your-api-key")
}

try {
  val result = yChatGpt.completion()
     .setInput("Say this is a test.")
     .saveHistory(false)
     .setMaxTokens(1024)
     .set... // you can set more parameters
     .execute()
  
} catch (e: exception) {
  // catch any error that may occurs on api call.  
}
```
